Repository to maintain my contributions to D4D's project Incarceration Trends

Collaborating with D4D to find trends in the incarceration rate in US, this repo maintains my contributions to the project. At the moment, I have studied the crime recommits on a year wise basis (for each county) to find the rate of recommits when people are released on bond.

The analysis can be found in the report
