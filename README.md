# D4D-Incarceration-Trends
Repository to maintain my contributions to Data4Democracy's project Incarceration Trends (https://github.com/Data4Democracy/incarceration-trends)

Collaborating with D4D to find trends in the incarceration rate in US, this repo maintains my contributions to the project. At the moment, I have studied the crime recommits on a year wise basis (for each county) to find the rate of recommits when people are released on bond.

The analysis can be found in the report Whoisbehindthebars.md

The jupyter notebook for the same has also been pushed.
